An overview of the environments and the virtual, and physical resources
utilized for the **xNVMe** **CI** is illustrated below.

   xNVMe **CI** environments and resources

The above figure is outdated, as **bench** and **verify** have been migrated
to a MaaS provider and are no longer on-premises. However, one system remains
on-prem because no MaaS provider currently offers a suitable replacement.

Infrastructure
##############

The main logical infrastructure component for the **xNVMe** **CI** is `GitHub
Actions`_ (**GHA**). **GHA** handles **events** occuring on the following
repositories:

* https://github.com/xnvme/xnvme/
* https://github.com/xnvme/xnvme.github.io
* https://github.com/xnvme/xnvme-docker
* https://github.com/xnvme/dpdk-windows-drivers

And decides what to execute and where. In other words **GHA** is utilized as a
**resource-scheduler** and **pipeline-engine**. The **executor** role is
delegated to `CIJOE`_ for details, then have a look at `CIJOE in xNVMe`_.

The motivation for this separation is to make it simpler to reproduce build,
test, and verfication issues occuring during a **CI** run, using locally
available resources, by executing the `CIJOE in xNVMe`_ workflows and scripts.

Jobs
####

The jobs performed by the **xNVMe** **CI** catch the following issues during
integration of changes / contributions:

* Code format issues

  - Linting and code-formating
  - clang-format for C
  - clippy for Rust
  - black / ruff for Python

* Build issues

  - Build with debug enabled and disabled
  - Detect linking issues with both the static and shared library
  - Tested on every OS listed in the :ref:`sec-toolchain` section
  
* Functional regressions

  - Running logical tests exercising all code-paths
  - Using a naive "ramdisk" backend
  - Using emulated NVMe devices via qemu
  - Using physical machines

In addition to cathing issues, then the CI is also utilized for:

* Benchmarking of xNVMe

  - Using physical machines
  - Measure peak IOPS for a single physical CPU core
  - Specifically for the integration of xNVMe in SPDK (``bdev_xnvme``)

* Statically Analyze the C code-base

  - CodeQL via GitHub
  - Coverity

* Produce and deploy documentation

  - Run all example commands (``.cmd`` files) and collect their output in
    ``.out`` files
  - Render the Sphinx-doc documentation as **HTML**
  - Upload rendered documentation to `xnvme.io via GitHub-pages`_

These following sections provide system-setup notes and other details for the
various **CI** jobs.
